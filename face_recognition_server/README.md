You can host the facial recognition model on a server on your laptop or an AWS instance if you don't want to use funcX. `facial_recognition_on_server.py` includes the necessary code for running it on a server. 

You can submit the pictures directly to this server from the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect.

You might need to configure access to ports to make it work.
